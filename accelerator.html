							Natural Language Processing is a large category in Artificial Intelligence.
							It allows for use to communicate with technology and for technology to analyze
							language data efficiently.
							This computation can take time with large scale projects, and our job was to improve performance speeds
							using a hardware accelerator. This would have been showcased using an FPGA board
							for proof of application.
						</p>
                        <p> 
							My team consisted of three other engineering students and myself. This was the largest project
							I worked on and my first real introduction to the design process in a team setting. We constantly brain stormed,
							helped each other with different approaches, and if we were stuck with our design, we would ask
							each other for help.

                        <p>This project consisted of 4 subsystems, and the subsystem I was in charge of was the
							Compact Random Forest Classifier(CRF) Core. The reason I chose to implement a random forest in hardware
							is because our task was Text Classification and Named Entity Recognition.
						</p>
						<p>
							Normally a sRandom Forest Classifier would span way too large for it to be implemented
							on an FPGA; however, I found a research paper discussing the applications of an Compact
							Random Forest.
						</p>
						<p>
							Additionally, the initial application used in the research paper wasn't applied to NLP.
							So I learned about word embeddings and how they can turn words into vectors. This allows
							for computers to not only recognize a word but also associate similarities and meanings.
						</p>
						<p>
							The solution I used was to train a compact random forest using large data sets of word vectors
							in python initially. After the model was trained and accurate enough, I would have downloaded .
							Then upload the threshold values to the hardware implementation.

						<p>Unfortunately, due to the pandemic this project was cut short before 
							I was able to implement these concepts onto hardware. However, I was
							able to code and verify the project in Verilog, which you can find on
							my github alongside the software implementation of the code.
